            <h2 id="i-dont-know-where-to-start">I don&rsquo;t know where to start</h2>
<p>Life is cyclical, sometimes we define different plans, different paths to follow, those can be set by someone else, or can be chosen by ourselves. But we set different plans for ourselves as time flies, and this world keeps us guessing for what&rsquo;s next. Ever since I started this path as a game developer, I set my destiny somewhat high up, in 2020, I decided that I was going to be a gamedev youtuber, I followed that path ever since.</p>
<p>But it feels that it&rsquo;s time for a pause, not saying that I want to stop this project, but my brain keeps me awake at nights giving me reasons why and why not to keep this path, I want to be successful, just like anybody. But I think that it is necessary to evolve to be able to succeed in this life.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-my-reasoning-of-why-im-thinking-of-pausing">Understanding my reasoning of why I&rsquo;m thinking of pausing</h2>
<p>I was naive, I told myself that I could just sacrifice everything, and only focus on this one thing, this one project, becoming a full time youtuber, and naturally from there, I could do bigger and bigger projects, bigger and bigger plans.</p>
<p>But naturally my plan didn&rsquo;t work, maybe I was wrong with the goals I set for myself, I expected bigger and bigger results from my efforts. But I was somewhat wrong.
I mean, I did manage to hit 1000 subs in my main channel, I did manage to finish a somewhat big videogame in this year, I  did manage to do many things, but I was naive in one thing, and one thing only:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put all of your eggs in one basket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sacrificed a lot of things, I sacrificed my mental health, my financial stability, many things that now, I think have made me more and more stressed about life, and what I should expect for my future.</p>
<p>It may sound kind of scary the way I described it, it&rsquo;s not like I have a big ass debt or anything like that, do not worry, it&rsquo;s more of me not having a job, or not a paid one at least, I did some projects here and there, but I wasted a lot of time, on trying to make this youtube thing work, as my main thing, I was naive, I have the support of my parents, but I&rsquo;m tired and stressed from the lack of actually getting any results, and feeling like a dead weight.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-pausing-means-for-my-youtube-channel-and-my-personal-project">What does pausing means for my youtube channel, and my personal project</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to focus primarily on getting a full time job, that means in the current time, that I will not be able to upload videos at all, or maybe it would be more of some updates here and there, for example, the cool thing about focusing on DEV jobs, I still could be delivering videos about the projects that I do, but I will no longer going to be doing videogames, or not yet, once I have something better set for my financial stability.</p>
<p>And once I have that job set, and maybe a bit more stability, I will be able to keep on creating in my free time. There&rsquo;s a well known common thought between all the creators from the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you finish your work hours, it&rsquo;s time to go to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea might be, that once I get my workday from software development, I could comeback to this channel in my free time. But now it would be a less stressed path.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-the-end">Is this the End?</h2>
<p>No, but I think it&rsquo;s a necessary step forward, for me. And my future plans, I could even have more opportunities of bigger investments for my projects, from having a better stability in my financial aspects.</p>
<p>Hopefully everything will work out&hellip;</p>
