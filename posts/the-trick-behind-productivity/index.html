            <h2 id="what-is-productivity">What is Productivity?</h2>
<p>You have probably felt the same, you&rsquo;re exploring different youtube videos about the topic of self improvement, productivity and how to use your time efficiently to make more things, get more money, make your own business, etc etc.</p>
<p>The truth is that the current digital era has taught us that there&rsquo;s a possibility of becoming better, becoming more productive doing X, Y an Z actions. Learn 10 different tips and tricks about how to become more productive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently there, literally have been binge watching different videos about the topic, I&rsquo;ve felt a bit sad about everything that I&rsquo;ve accomplish, but at the same time I&rsquo;ve spent a ton of time doing not much progress.</p>
<p>So first of all, [what&rsquo;s productivity?].</p>
<p>Productivity is the efficient use of time, to accomplish certain tasks. Or that is the best I would describe it. It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re doing 10 things at the same time, but you&rsquo;re being efficient with your time and you&rsquo;re actually doing different task through the time that you&rsquo;ve set for work.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-it-feel-like-we-fetishize-productivity">Why does it feel like we fetishize Productivity?</h3>
<p>Every time I open youtube I get bombarded with thousands of productivity videos, mostly because as you might do, we&rsquo;ve been lacking the feeling of accomplishment, and youtube knows that we want that, the feeling of accomplishment, and that way we get recommended with thousands of youtube videos about people being productive.</p>
<p>We live in an era where being productive is being rewarded with a ton of dopamine, and a certain degree of happiness.
I think that the reason why we live in a &ldquo;Productivity Era&rdquo;, is because ever since the industrial age, the rapid growth of the economy and society, it feels like we should be like machines, machines that should be after something, machines that should not spend their time doing anything but being productive.</p>
<p>We want to find meaning through action, through feeling like we&rsquo;re using our time effectively.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-be-more-productive">How can we be more productive?</h2>
<p>The truth is, you should erase all the old preconception of productivity to be productive.</p>
<p>We should stop focusing on getting more things done, being busy all the time, think about doing 5 businesses at the same time. Delete all that crap, and focus on what truly matters.</p>
<p>Enjoying your time.</p>
<p>And no, I&rsquo;m not saying that we should stop being &ldquo;productive&rdquo;, and just live life like it goes, don&rsquo;t do anything but things that make me feel good right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually saying the opposite, we should strive towards doing activities that we enjoy, if you enjoy developing videogames, go ahead, do it, focus your time in both learning and producing things, learn with actions, and overall try to put enough or your time towards that.
We should do [something that we enjoy], [something that we&rsquo;re good at], and [something that we could make a living out of].
The 3 are the most important things to get, synergy between the 3 will get you further in life.</p>
<h3 id="in-my-case">In my case&hellip;</h3>
<p>In my case when I think about these 3 bullets, I come with to the next conclusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Something I Enjoy: &ldquo;Solving Problems, making experiences, making a thing that someone will enjoy, and overall development of applications that solve something.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Something that I&rsquo;m good at: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at development, I&rsquo;m good at entertaining people, I&rsquo;m good at coming with solutions, I&rsquo;m good at understanding tools like programming languages to develop experiences for people.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Something that I could make a living out of: &ldquo;Software Development (either gamedev, apps, front  end, etc), Youtube (this one is a bit tricky, because it could be a living, but it takes time)&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="now-what">Now what?</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve ask yourself the same questions, and I answered mine, we could kinda set a plan, but to set a plan, we could do some research on tips and tricks to become more productive. Because motivation will get you in a good path towards success. But it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>To be honest, being disciplined is far better than just seeking for motivation, I mean, I&rsquo;m the best example of it, I have literally stopped doing youtube videos because I didn&rsquo;t felt motivated enough.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why we might need the next tools, tips and tricks moving forward:</p>
<h3 id="first-thing-when-you-wake-up-no-distractions-write-down-the-three-most-important-goals-for-the-day-and-set-your-day-expectations">First thing when you wake up: No distractions, Write Down the Three Most Important Goals for the Day, and set your Day Expectations.</h3>
<p>What are the distractions that we should avoid first thing in the morning? Phones, Social Media, anything that literally have the set goal to get your entire attention, and make you waste time, to give you meaningless dopamine.</p>
<p>Why should we avoid them? Easy, your waking hours are very important, they somewhat set how the day is going to go, if you use that time distracting yourself with the outside world, with random notifications, and things that you feel that don&rsquo;t give you anything, then why should you spend time on it, right?</p>
<p>After you wake up it would be good to set the Three Most Important Tasks to accomplish today, those three things that you want to accomplish for the day, of course do not set the expectations to high,  set something that is actually doable.</p>
<p>For example, today:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to make a post in my personal blog</li>
<li>Finish 3 Minutes of my video of: &ldquo;I made FROGGER but with RAGDOLL Physics (like Fall Guys)&rdquo;</li>
<li>Design my Portfolio website with Figma (A one page website to showcase my abilities)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the things that I set myself to do today, I&rsquo;m literally accomplishing one just now, by making this blog post for you, and for me.</p>
<p>And setting the expectations of the day it might be tricky, put aside your ego, do not feel bad if things do not go your way, it&rsquo;s not like days will always go as planned, but whenever you can do progress, do as much as possible, use your time effectively, and now, how can you use your time effectively?</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-in-your-day-to-day-break-down-your-three-goals-for-the-day-into-pieces-eliminate-distractions-use-time-management-techniques-pomodoro-gtd-etc-and-use-your-time-wisely">What to do in your day to day: Break down your Three Goals for the day into pieces, Eliminate Distractions, Use Time Management Techniques (Pomodoro, GTD, etc), and use your time wisely.</h3>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve wake up, it&rsquo;s time for work, as you might have done the day before or in the morning, you&rsquo;ve set time for working, eliminating distractions is the way forward.</p>
<p>How? By using technology lmao.</p>
<p>If your work is using a lot your computer, then set the notifications off, get website blockers (blocking social medias, youtube, etc), get distraction blocker extensions. There are multiple tools, my top 4 chrome/firefox add ons or extensions are the next:</p>
<ul>
<li>DF YouTube (Distraction Free) - As it says, it eliminates all the distractions from youtube, to have a better use of it as an actual tool, not that much of entertainment.</li>
<li>UnDistracted - This one Hides Feeds from different Social Medias such as Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, etc.</li>
<li>Dark Reader - If you&rsquo;re like me this one it&rsquo;s more like an extra, I tend to use the computer very often, so this one actually helps my eyes, to add dark mode to any website, that way I can stay more often in my PC working.</li>
<li>Focus To-Do: Pomodoro Timer &amp; To Do List, this one it&rsquo;s going to help in cas you want to use the pomodoro technique of working 30 minutes, having a short break of 5 minutes, and a To Do List with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about TIme Management Techniques? Well there are plenty and I will probably not talk much about most of them, but the mains that come to my mind when talking about time management techniques are Pomodoro, Kanban Board or TO-DO Board, the 2 minute rule and another one that might not be a time management technique but it&rsquo;s a productivity one, is the &ldquo;just another task&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The pomodoro technique is using a timer set with 3 main variables, so you work for 30 to 45 minutes straight with high focus, then you go and do a 5 minute break period, then go back and do another 30 to 45 minutes of high focus work, that way till you do it 4 times, and then do a long break of 15 to 20 minutes. This one is somewhat recommended, not my favorite, but more of a starting point if you&rsquo;ve never being productive in your life, like a starting position. Because once you get into flow state, then breaks will not matter that much, or you will naturally take small breaks while working after making a flow rush of work.</p>
<p>The Kanban board or To-Do Board is one I like to set all the tasks, in other words, like Trello having 4 to 5 Containers for tasks, the first one is the INBOX, where we throw different tasks that whe might or might not do, the second container is the TO-DO container, where we put all the tasks that we will actually do. Then you have the DOING container, where we put the main task that I&rsquo;m currently doin, at this moment. Another one could be the TESTING container, this one is in case you are not fully sure that the task is done, maybe a part of the project that needs a bit more testing before saying that it is done. And at last the DONE container, this one is for those tasks that are actually done, and don&rsquo;t matter now.</p>
<p>The 2 Minute rule comes in play whenever you have a tasks that don&rsquo;t take more than 2 minutes, to just do it now, and in someway for certain people that technique make them get to a flow state of finishing tasks.</p>
<p>And at last but not least important we have the Productivity technique that I learnt just recently is a flow technique that I like to name &ldquo;Just another task&rdquo;. This one is a bit like the 2 minute rule but instead of focusing on the faster tasks, I focus on the whole list of tasks, and focus on just one task a time, and by saying to my brain that I will just do another task, just like the way you say: JUST ANOTHER COOKIE, but then end up eating the whole package of cookies, it&rsquo;s the same idea.
Making just one more, and just one more, and just one more, and then when you least expect it. You&rsquo;ve done way more than you expected at first.</p>
<h3 id="once-you-finish-what-now-rest-relax-enjoy-life-praise-your-accomplishments-of-the-day-and-write-what-you-will-do-tomorrow">Once you finish what now? Rest, Relax, Enjoy Life, Praise your accomplishments of the day, and write what you will do tomorrow.</h3>
<p>I hope that with that title you get the whole idea of what to do once you finish your day of work, life it&rsquo;s not just working, working on what it&rsquo;s your passion gives meaning to life, but you should enjoy your time too, of course I&rsquo;m not saying that you should go party or something, I&rsquo;m talking about what truly matters, the people around you.</p>
<p>Go out with your friends, talk with them, do an activity whenever possible, do something that you enjoy, do not over do it too, you shouldn&rsquo;t just play 4 hours of videogames now, everything with their own limit.</p>
<p>There should always be a limit to not be exceeded with everything, with work, with games, with everything. Just don&rsquo;t over do it.
Enjoy what you&rsquo;ve accomplished for the day, and move forward setting some goals for tomorrow, write, draw, do anything that you feel like doing right now, and 1 hour before bed, stop using any digital device (to have a good sleep).</p>
<h2 id="thats-the-trick">That&rsquo;s the trick</h2>
<p>That would be the closest to an overview of what do to in your day. I might do more posts like this, just for myself and for any random person that could one day might read this whole things.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far, thanks for being here, you&rsquo;ve a ton of time, and a ton of things that you will do, you got this, and the best of lucks.</p>
