      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start Life is cyclical, sometimes we define different plans, different paths to follow, those can be set by someone else, or can be chosen by ourselves. But we set different plans for ourselves as time flies, and this world keeps us guessing for what&amp;rsquo;s next. Ever since I started this path as a game developer, I set my destiny somewhat high up, in 2020, I decided that I was going to be a gamedev youtuber, I followed that path ever since.</description>

      <description>It happens, even to the best of all of us&amp;hellip; Life is interesting sometimes, it bless you with people, it bless you with time, it bless you with commodity, it bless you with many things to be grateful for. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie, life is beautiful, but no matter what, there days, just like this, where life makes you think, makes you analyze your relationships, your passions, your projects, your path.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s understand the WHY&amp;rsquo;s? Howdy, welcome to a new small post. I understand this might not even be an interesting topic to read about, because it is entirely just about me, myself and my plans ahead in this wonderful and interesting life. If this is the first time you read a post of mine, this might not be the best of introductions, so go ahead and try others instead, like the recent post I made regarding Unity&amp;rsquo;s decisions.</description>
