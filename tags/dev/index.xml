      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start Life is cyclical, sometimes we define different plans, different paths to follow, those can be set by someone else, or can be chosen by ourselves. But we set different plans for ourselves as time flies, and this world keeps us guessing for what&amp;rsquo;s next. Ever since I started this path as a game developer, I set my destiny somewhat high up, in 2020, I decided that I was going to be a gamedev youtuber, I followed that path ever since.</description>

      <description>Why Am I switching to becoming a Web Developer? I&amp;rsquo;m a game developer, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a game developer ever since 2017, I started in a very early stage, by doing simple projects here and there, by following a ton of tutorials, and since 2021, I started to get more and more interested into becoming a web developer. I&amp;rsquo;ve found joy in developing websites, and tools with this websites. It&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting process.</description>

      <description>Dear Unity Unity is a game engine that I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past, and I&amp;rsquo;m willing to say was my dear tool to make most of my ideas a reality in the gamedev world, I created my first videogame with it, and it is allocated in a very special place in my heart, I started using this game engine since 2014, not full time obviously, but it was absolutely a game changer.</description>

      <description>Why did I Personalized my Terminal? Howdy random stranger, welcome to another blog post, in today&amp;rsquo;s topic I&amp;rsquo;m explaining a bit of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this entire weekend, lmao.
But before I kinda explain a bit about the personalization of my personal terminal, let me explain a bit about how I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the terminal before, and my settings before this whole mess lmao.
The Process&amp;hellip; Before. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a simple dev, the closest thing of using the terminal it has been more related to that one time last year when I used Linux actively to learn deeper in terms of Web Development.</description>
