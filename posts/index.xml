      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s understand the WHY&amp;rsquo;s? Howdy, welcome to a new small post. I understand this might not even be an interesting topic to read about, because it is entirely just about me, myself and my plans ahead in this wonderful and interesting life. If this is the first time you read a post of mine, this might not be the best of introductions, so go ahead and try others instead, like the recent post I made regarding Unity&amp;rsquo;s decisions.</description>

      <description>Dear Unity Unity is a game engine that I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past, and I&amp;rsquo;m willing to say was my dear tool to make most of my ideas a reality in the gamedev world, I created my first videogame with it, and it is allocated in a very special place in my heart, I started using this game engine since 2014, not full time obviously, but it was absolutely a game changer.</description>

      <description>Why did I Personalized my Terminal? Howdy random stranger, welcome to another blog post, in today&amp;rsquo;s topic I&amp;rsquo;m explaining a bit of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this entire weekend, lmao.
But before I kinda explain a bit about the personalization of my personal terminal, let me explain a bit about how I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the terminal before, and my settings before this whole mess lmao.
The Process&amp;hellip; Before. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a simple dev, the closest thing of using the terminal it has been more related to that one time last year when I used Linux actively to learn deeper in terms of Web Development.</description>
