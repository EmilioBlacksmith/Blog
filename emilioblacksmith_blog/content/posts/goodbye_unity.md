# Dear Unity
Unity is a game engine that I've used in the past, and I'm willing to say was my dear tool to make most of my ideas a reality in the gamedev world, I created my first videogame with it, and it is allocated in a very special place in my heart, I started using this game engine since 2014, not full time obviously, but it was absolutely a game changer.
I started by doing a small tutorial series, making a physics/platformer game where you needed to roll a ball thru obstacles and get it to the end point. from what I recall this videogame was named "I'm a jedi", or something like that, I literally took a 3D model of a hand, put it right next to the camera and call it a day.
I felt so cool, felt like I could do absolutely anything with this tool.
After a while, once I got to college I did my official first first full game, it was a school project named: [King of Monsters](https://eddyposible.itch.io/king-of-monsters). It was a small project based on the Touhou, a trashy bullet hell videogame, where you control King Ghidorah, a big Kaiju from Godzilla's Universe.
At the end of the videogame you could go against Godzilla himself. It was really fun to work on it, stressful but very fun.
That same year I participated in my first ever game jam, it was an online game jam, I was part of the brackey's discord community, and back then I saw a post about someone looking to participate in a game jam named "The 2-Buttons Jam 2018".
What's the catch of this game jam? Well you can only use 2 Buttons to control the whole videogame lol.
I met some great fellow developers in it, from around the world, it was stressful, but really fun.

I could talk and talk a ton about different projects that I participated and where I used the unity game engine. Unity made a tool that was my holy grail, the place where all of my ideas for games would turn to be a reality. I felt that this company was working on something great, the tool to let people make games. And they accomplished that, that's something that we cannot take from them. They allowed people like me to get closer to become game developers.

But a few days ago, out of the blue, unity released some changes. Some changes that I feel like nobody where expecting them to do.

One small change to be exact: "The way they are going to monetize their engine". And not any type of monetization, we are talking about the now infamous fee per install. So in other words, after the videogame cross the threshold of 200,000 copies installed, they now ask for a fee, this is a $.20 USD fee for each install, doesn't sound bad, the issue is that how can they know how many "INSTALLS" is the game having? How can they track if that install was made by legal ways? How can they track the difference between an install from a store vs an install from the xbox game pass?
Their official statement felt more like a "TRUST ME BRO", more than a peaceful agreement between gamedevs and the engine's company. The way they are tracking this is by using the runtime data from every time the game launches, to track the number of installs.

I have so many issues against this fee. Not because of me being greedy and not wanting to support the tools that I love, but because I feel that one thing is fee per install vs fee per sell. One thing is way different from the other. It feels so wrong to be asking for money for every time a game is being installed. Imagine what if a user installs a game more than just one time?
I don't know about you, but sometimes I uninstall games, and install them again after a while?

But well, It's not only that small fee, I mean, it's not like I'm already selling 200,000 copies of every game that I sell. But here is a deal breaker for me.
[Unity deleted a repository from their github repos](https://www.gamerbraves.com/unity-silently-deletes-github-repo-that-tracks-terms-of-service-changes-and-updated-its-license/). And not any repo, we're talking about the one that allows the public to track any changes made to the license agreements and lets developers use the terms from older versions of the game engine that their product was shipped with.
What does that mean? well the developers cannot use the older agreements that they "signed" indirectly when shipping their videogames, allowing unity to do the bad practice of: Well you now will follow the new agreements lol.

I hope you understand the way I'm understanding and seeing this. This is borderline Illegal, and imagine what could happen in the future, what could unity do anytime. I mean they could "Revert" this changes, yes. But that doesn't repair the damage.
They are making bad business against us, the developers. And I can only imagine what could happen tomorrow if unity out of the blue decides something worst than this move...
And this are the main reasons why I no longer support and recommend people to use this engine for the future. I'm in a borderline frightened position with unity and no longer feel safe using their game engine.
It was fun while it lasted, I can only say good things for this engine and their developers behind this tool. But these higher-up decisions and actions are really bad, and have allow me to decide what's next for me...

# What's next?
I've been meditating this a lot, it's funny because we, as developers tend to treat out tools as our babies, it's a really big commitment to change from one to another. Funny enough, I started to learn godot for a while now, I was intending to do a small project with godot for a video, and I've been learning so many new skills (mostly cuz I'm trying to find a front web dev job), I've been making small steps into becoming engine-less lol.
I started to tinker with javascript frameworks like Three.js to make a small game with it. and not only that I wanted to use godot for a game jam, to learn new tools.
But after unity's decisions and actions I'm no longer going to be using the unity game engine, what does that mean?

It means 2 practical things that I'll be doing in the future for both my channel and my dev areas:
- Using GODOT to develop the unofficial PC Sports. (this is very early, I'm going to be making the prototype for the next video after the one that is coming right away about the videogame that I developed "Mother Frogger")
- And this is the very first time that I have publicly talked about this small thing that I intend to work on, while working on the PC Sports game. A brand new game engine made by me, yes, I'm relearning most of my rusty c++ skills, to actively develop my own game engine, it's going to be a very simple 3D engine, that if it works, and I enjoy working on it. It might become the main engine for every single project of mine moving forward. (The unofficial name for this game engine is: "Blacksmith Engine"). Funny enough Ubisoft already owns the name for the engine that I wanted: Ubisoft Anvil. Mostly because as you already know I'm the blacksmith, who needs an Anvil to make games for you lol.

But that would be it, that is my plan moving forward, my intentions for the future, and what makes me wake up every day excited to work. I will be doing some extra things too, and everything will be talked about in my youtube channel, my new branding is that "I make development fun to watch (sometimes...)". And that's why I'm embracing the learning new tools approach, I'll be making way more projects for my youtube channel, not only gamedev, but also web dev, desktop application development too.

I hope that you're exited for the future just like me, and that if you read all of this whole things, thanks for being here, I hope we can be friends, so go ahead and email me, or send me a msg in my socials. Love you.

See you Around, Cowboy! ðŸ¤
