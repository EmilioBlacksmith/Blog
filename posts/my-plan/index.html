            <h2 id="lets-understand-the-whys">Let&rsquo;s understand the WHY&rsquo;s?</h2>
<p>Howdy, welcome to a new small post. I understand this might not even be an interesting topic to read about, because it is entirely just about me, myself and my plans ahead in this wonderful and interesting life.
If this is the first time you read a post of mine, this might not be the best of introductions, so go ahead and try others instead, like the recent post I made regarding <a href="https://emilioblacksmith.github.io/Blog/posts/goodbye_unity/">Unity&rsquo;s decisions</a>.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; here we go.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Why am I feeling stressed?]</li>
<li>[Is everything alright?]</li>
<li>[Is my youtube going to die?]</li>
<li>[Will I continue doing what I&rsquo;m doing?]</li>
<li>[What should I do?]</li>
</ul>
<p>This and many more questions come and go through my head, almost in a daily bases nowadays. Is it anxiety? probably. But it needs to stop.</p>
<h2 id="where-am-i-currently-at">Where am I currently at?</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first analyze, the current position that I&rsquo;m currently at. From the financial perspective, to the physical health, social, physiological, career wise. Everything.</p>
<h3 id="physical-health-80">Physical Health. (80%)</h3>
<p>As you can see, I&rsquo;m going to somewhat rate the state I perceive this areas of my life, with numbers. It might be the logical side of me that tries to optimize everything, and relies too much on numbers to explain most things in my life.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; In Physical Health, I&rsquo;ve been OK, overall I would say that I&rsquo;m currently in a position that it&rsquo;s good enough, not perfect, but life is not meant to be perfect all the time.
Since the beginning of 2021, I started a journey of self improvement through doing exercise, and improving the way I eat in a daily basis, it started with going out to the park and do some exercises, and it has been evolving ever since.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost getting to the point where I feel happy with my body and my overall mental health regarding feeling enough.
It&rsquo;s weird, but I feel that loving yourself makes you wanna be better and improve your overall body and health, optimize your time, and make you a better individual, by being responsible with your body.</p>
<p>BUT&hellip; it also creates a never ending journey to be better, get stronger, be healthier, be a bit better every day kind of mindset. I&rsquo;m happy with how strong I&rsquo;ve become, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to see how much my body can do in the future, by continuing this path of improvement.</p>
<h3 id="social-life-75">Social Life (75%)</h3>
<p>This is a tough one, not necessarily because I feel like I don&rsquo;t have friends, or a community that I can rely on. But because one small funny detail&hellip; the romantic side of my social life.
I&rsquo;ve become a loner when it comes to love, and the somewhat sad thing about it, it&rsquo;s somewhat of a choice, but it comes with some regrets. What I&rsquo;m trying to explain is that, There comes days where I feel alone, where I would wish to have a love partner to go through this ride alongside.
But at the same time, I&rsquo;m neither ready, or do the actions that will help me get to the point where I&rsquo;ll be happy with my love life.</p>
<p>For example, this might be a TMI thing, but it has been some time now since I&rsquo;ve met a girl from my gym, that I do find very attractive, and would love to know her further, but instead of doing that, making an effort and actually getting to know her, and do anything, a move, a: Hey wassup señorita?. ANYTHING.</p>
<p>Instead I haven&rsquo;t done anything ever since I saw her, not even a glimpse of movement to show my interest lol.
And the worst thing about it, is that this is NOT the first time I do that, I&rsquo;m a little b$#@ch when it comes to trying things out in the romantic side. I don&rsquo;t go straight to the point, I don&rsquo;t show my interests, I don&rsquo;t show anything that might turn something into a possibility.</p>
<p>Instead, I just &ldquo;accept&rdquo; my faith of dying alone, or something like that lol.</p>
<p>And that is something that I need to work on&hellip; And I will work on. Do Something.
Even if I have my own insecurities that make me not do anything, just face my fears.</p>
<h3 id="mental-health-50">Mental Health (50%)</h3>
<p>If you would have ask me this, half a year ago, I would probably would have answer with an astonishing 90%, instead it seems and feels like I&rsquo;ve gone through a rabbit hole of bad decisions regarding my mental health.
Is it too bad? not to that extent. but I&rsquo;ve committed many things that have provoked many feelings of insecurity, lack of purpose, and lack of motivation.</p>
<p>A really small overview would be the next:</p>
<ul>
<li>My wrong doings have cause me to feel like I&rsquo;m not good enough, smart enough, good enough, and overall I&rsquo;ve been in a row of doing bad actions such as &gt; Not sleeping well, going back to certain addictions (nothing too bad, so don&rsquo;t worry, but addictions nonetheless), not doing any type of activity for my mental health, I stopped meditating, I stopped being mindful, I stop many things that have help me before. And all of that because of my own lack of discipline, happiness, and feeling like what I&rsquo;m doing is meaningless.</li>
</ul>
<p>PHEW! who would have thought that all of this started with me stopping meditation lol.</p>
<h3 id="career-wise-50">Career Wise (50%)</h3>
<p>This have been the same ever since the beginning of this year, and when I say career wise, I&rsquo;m talking about my overall career / job / purpose. My purpose has been weird lately, I&rsquo;ve changed dramatically towards a MEH direction. I haven&rsquo;t explored what I want in my life&hellip; Well not really, I have. But it has been a while since I&rsquo;ve ask the true questions of my purpose.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering if I should continue with my youtube channel, the answer has been YES. I want to do it full time, and before I&rsquo;ve actually done it as my fulltime thing even if it wasn&rsquo;t a paid thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>What has changed? Well, I feel somewhat lost, I don&rsquo;t know what to do, or maybe I don&rsquo;t feel as excited with the current project that it has been in the making for a while now. I did Frogger as a small project that turned out to be a long one, But to be honest, once I post the video about Frogger I will do something way different in my channel, I will do video every other week, It will be a more of a part series of Development.</li>
<li>Why? Idk, It feels like doing something long as FROGGER would have been a bit better if I&rsquo;ve done it as a part series before, instead of just one video&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about getting a real job? In the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve actually gone through a process of elimination regarding what should I do in terms of remuneration and a real job. I&rsquo;m thinking about doing front end dev as my job, and once I&rsquo;m back from work, get back to my youtube stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is my purpose? I don&rsquo;t truly know, a long time ago, I actually defined my goal as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My purpose is to GIVE, that&rsquo;s why, first, I need to HAVE.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In other words, I need to have a better health, a better mental health, a better financial state, a better social state, in general have many things to give to others, and that way, have a happier life. Or what I thinks is a happier life for me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Things like that have been in my head, somewhat causing a shit ton of sleepless nights, and emotions of feeling like I&rsquo;m not good enough, and I have a ton of things to do for a better life.</p>
<h3 id="financial-state-25">Financial State (25%)</h3>
<p>This of course is heavily related to the Career Wise section, of course, career helps to have more wealth, and overall have a better financial state. What is my current financial state? Well MEH.
I don&rsquo;t make any money from my project (yet). Most of my money comes from doing small freelance work, or something like that, by doing what I can, with what I have, but it is not a sustainable way of living, when it comes to having the possibility of having a better life for myself.
Thank god I currently don&rsquo;t have any debt, but that doesn&rsquo;t take that I need to have a set amount of wealth to be able to afford things like giving out, going out, and overall having things for myself.</p>
<p>Something great is that I currently have the support of my family, so It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m homeless or something, but I need to have something, something that I enjoy, and would allow me to give to my family a better life.
give myself a better place, a bette setup, to be able to experience more things in life , just like traveling, having small adventures, be able to afford a good living.</p>
<p>So yeah, right now I can&rsquo;t say that I have a great financial state, but it&rsquo;s in the making.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-plan-then">What&rsquo;s the plan then?</h2>
<p>So after having this whole talk about how I feel regarding my current situation and life, let&rsquo;s talk business, let&rsquo;s talk about my plan, what I&rsquo;m going to focus on, and what It&rsquo;s ahead for me in this life&hellip; I mean this shit show has just begun, I&rsquo;m 24, I have a ton of time ahead, so I need to focus on what&rsquo;s important, trying to become happier, and do what makes the most sense for my future.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to set this as a quadrants of focus:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Work / Passion:</p>
<p>a. Work: I&rsquo;m going to focus on 2 things when it comes to work:</p>
<pre><code> i. Learn and Improve to become a better front end developer and web developer
 ii. Get a good paying job as a front end developer, with the stack of: Angular, React, Typescript, et.
</code></pre>
<p>b. Passion: In my free time I&rsquo;m going to focus on becoming, what my banner says. A youtuber who makes DEV fun to watch (sometimes), that means:</p>
<pre><code> i. Game Development: in the current moment I'm focused on starting a project once the FROGGER video is out, that project is the unofficial PC Sports videogame, it is going to be made using GODOT.
 ii. App Development: there's one thing that I want to do when it comes to app development to make also a video about it, a desktop application for youtubers, TubePlanner, this one is to have more content for my channel, regarding development, so my free time would most likely to be an in between between gamedev and app dev, this is going to be made using TAURI and React. Just for the sake of also having a project that will get me hired.
 iii. Game Engine Development (Hobbies): something else that I might do, but it might literally be, only in the weekends, and to create more content, is the creation of my own game engine, just for fun, to be honest, it's more of a hobbies, so it's more likely like a fun project that I want to do for fun, and it's somewhat optional.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social:</p>
<p>a. Face my social anxiety and go ahead to face head on my fear of talking to girls and people outside, mainly slowly but surely, try to be more direct with my feelings and social overall.</p>
<p>b. Something that I will continue pursuing in the weekends is doing the game nights, something that I forgot to mention in the social section, is the fact that since the beginning of this month, I&rsquo;ve been doing game nights with my friends, it has help me a lot with the social needs, so I will continue to pursue it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical Health:</p>
<p>a. You got this king, lol. To be honest, as I&rsquo;ve said before, I&rsquo;ve been doing great at the gym, I&rsquo;ve been getting stronger and stronger, so I just need to focus on keep doing the same consistency and progress.</p>
<p>b. Improve a little bit of my diet, just to have a better overall progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental Health:</p>
<p>a. something that I&rsquo;m going to back to, is the daily meditation, it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve lost through the passing of time, and something that was very helpful for me. So I&rsquo;m going to go back to it, right away.</p>
<p>b. Stop consuming my addiction, to have a better self perception.</p>
<p>c. Just accept myself, take time as I can, and don&rsquo;t set over complicated hight expectations, I&rsquo;m 24, I have time to do everything that I set to do.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading</h2>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t meant to be for anyone else more than myself, it&rsquo;s a post to set my head free of every bad thought that I&rsquo;ve gather over the past few weeks, and something that It&rsquo;s going to help me have a better direction to sail towards, I&rsquo;m happy with the whole plan and ideas, and it was helpful for myself.</p>
<p>So if you ever feel like this could be something useful, ask yourself the same type of questions as I did in this post, and you got this, go ahead and make the plan, and live live at hits fullest.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have fun and focus.</p>
