# Welcome to my Blog :cowboy_hat_face:

Hello, howdy, how you doing, my name is Emilio Blacksmith (real name Emilio Herrera, BUT, Herrera in english is Blacksmith).

I'm a Developer, I've been doing Game Development since 2017. But wasn't till 2021 where I started a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@EmilioBlacksmith) focused on game development tutorials with tools like the unity game engine, then in 2022 I started to lean towards doing more entertainment content based on development. Currently I'm in a growing stage of wanting to do this full time, but at the same time wan't to learn new tools, not only in game development, but a bit of everything.

I want to be the best at my craft of being a Youtube Developer. I don't truly know if there's a niche out there in the field of everything software development, not only game dev, but also web dev, desktop application development, etc.

> What's my take in this?
>> I'm a Game Developer at heart, I care about UX, I care about adding gamification to everything, I like the idea of making games, and what if we take something like software development and we try to make something fun every time? sounds like a good idea, right?

## Why we still here? just to suffer?

This blog site, it's heavily focused on doing some random ass post here and there, I like the idea of having a way to save in a public place, everything that I've learn, everything that I've gather over the years, and actually try to give something away to the people.

### What I'm currently developing? (web dev wise, and game dev wise)

Fun Fact: I'm currently developing a desktop application using Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and Tauri, named TubePlanner, it's a youtuber tool made for youtubers by a youtuber. The main idea is to take inspiration from trello in the sense of how the kanban boards work, and instead of cards of to-do, doing, done. Those cards will be sections of the video, or chapters, where the person doing the youtube script can write inside this cards, and have the flexibility of moving everything the way the want it, and even export it to pdf in the order that they gave it to the timeline.

Currently this app it's in the making, but this is the first time that I've publicly have talked about it to anyone, so it's our little secret.

Other thing that I will start doing after the posting of the video game that I've been developing for the last 4 months (Mother Frogger, coming soon...), I'm planning on doing the Unofficial PC Sports.

### What is the idea behind the "Unofficial PC Sports"?

Do you remember the video game Wii Sports, from the beautiful WII console from NINTENDO? well I've been wondering how it would be to develop the first ever un-official pc sports, literally the idea is to try to make a sports game as good as wii sports, or switch sports, but for PC, with the focus of trying to make it accessible to everyone, and that the way it works is by using only the mouse.

This game is still really early in the making, literally I've done only a prototype, that is looking pretty good, I may add. It feels like a really fun video game experience focus, and the idea is to make it just like the wii sports with local single player, and a global multiplayer to play with your friends to see who's the best PC Sports Gamer.

## TODO of the Week
