## Here's a challenge, but why

Howdy, it's been a while since I wrote a blog post, there's plenty that I want to talk with you, but this post ain't about that, it's a different type of post focused towards a small thing that I've been thinking about, and just now starting to apply it on my day to day basis.

I've felt very sad, a lot of things have happen, but a key takeaway that might be important for this precise project, is the feeling of not being enough, feeling like I'm boring and that I don't bring any value to my relationships. That feeling has been very present in my need of wanting to excel in everything I do, and maybe a big reason behind why I wanted to do this small challenge.

You see, I've been in a musical rut, usually musicians talk about musical rut when we talk about a lack of inspiration and creativity when it comes to coming with new songs, or ideas. Well my definition of "Musical Rut", as listener, not musical artist, it's the feeling of being stuck in the same genre, the same songs, the same playlist, and feeling like I'm so dead boring that my music is so boring too.

that's the reason behind this challenge.

## A music genre every 3 days

As the title of this challenge suggest, it's dead simple, the idea is to hear a music genre every 3 days, but not any list, I managed to find and cleanup a 771 different music genres and sub genres.

If you want to check the genre list, here you go. [the fancy list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xAWZVuSTWNDX8B3IxPAVqDFwqXqoiRqJhb1os7Po1WA/edit?usp=sharing)

The idea is not to select one by yourself, but I'm actually using a random roulette generator where I copy and paste the list, and every 3 days I do a roulette try, and see what comes out of it. And obviously delete the one that gets selected.

## So where am I in this challenge?

I started 3 days ago, the first genre that got selected out of the roulette was "DUBTRONICA".

A bit of history behind Dubtronica. Dubtronica comes from a combination of two styles of music, DUB and ELECTRONICA. Dub is an electronic musical style that grew out of reggae in the late 60s and 70s. Dub consists of remixes of existing recordings, significantly manipulating the original. And you take that genre, and combine it with electronica music, and you get that: "DUBTRONICA".

It's interesting to find new and random music genres, it makes you notice about how all of us are interconnected by music, and every genre allow us to explore new ideas that weren't there before. It's amazing.

## That's all, lol

And that would be it, that's the challenge that I created, I don't know if there was something like it, but hopefully could help you explore new styles, genres and discover yourself in the process.

Thanks for reading this.
