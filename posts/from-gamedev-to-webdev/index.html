            <h2 id="why-am-i-switching-to-becoming-a-web-developer">Why Am I switching to becoming a Web Developer?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a game developer, I&rsquo;ve been a game developer ever since 2017, I started in a very early stage, by doing simple projects here and there, by following a ton of tutorials, and since 2021, I started to get more and more interested into becoming a web developer. I&rsquo;ve found joy in developing websites, and tools with this websites. It&rsquo;s a very interesting process.</p>
<p>The reason behind why am I doing more and more web development, it has to do with many factors, mostly it has to do with the availability of the workforce between being a game developer vs being a web developer, there are more opportunities, and usually game developers tend to be a very complex workforce to get into. And not only that, it tends to not be well paid compared to other Software Engineer areas.
It also tends to be the one that has the bad reputation of crunching more often, due to needing to deploy projects more often, compared to other software engineer positions, that tend to have a tight schedule, but the deployment tends to be less often.</p>
<p>And with all due respect, Game Development it&rsquo;s something that I love, I love developing games that people might enjoy, and might have a ton of fun playing. But I&rsquo;m not the type of developer who is into wanting to be part of the triple AAA industry, I like more the idea of creating my own team.</p>
<p>So taking all those factors into account, I decided no so long ago, that I was getting a full time job in web development, and doing my passion project on the side, in this case, the passion project being creating &ldquo;Blacksmith Softworks&rdquo;, a videogame company. That one might require more time, but nonetheless, it&rsquo;s my lifetime project, that I&rsquo;m going to build slowly but surely.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap-to-becoming-a-webdev">Roadmap to becoming a Webdev?</h2>
<p>Let me explain to you my Recommendation to switching from gamedev to webdev.</p>
<p>But for context, this Roadmap takes into account that you&rsquo;re like me, in the sense that you&rsquo;ve been a game developer for a while, you know how to code with either c#, gdscript, game maker&rsquo;s language, or even the crazy ones might know C++ with unreal engine.</p>
<p>So IF you&rsquo;re a gamedev with that prior knowledge, let me explain you this, Web Development it&rsquo;s a bit more friendly than coding with a game engine, or that would be the way I feel about web development, in the sense of how it works in Front End, I still need more experience in Backend to make my final conclusion.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn the Basics of HTML and CSS - This is the easiest, it&rsquo;s not programming, HTML it&rsquo;s a markup language, and css is a style sheet language, and both are the core nucleus behind everything in web development, what I would recommend is to do 2 small 1 page websites with HTML/CSS, and with CSS learn the core concept of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">FLEXBOX</a>.</li>
<li>Learn Javascript - Javascript or JS is the core behind everything web, most websites use it for the functionality, and it is a very powerful programming language. Compared to your prior knowledge of C#/C++/GDScript/Others, JS it&rsquo;s a very fresh and friendly programming language to learn, in terms of syntax it&rsquo;s friendly, loosely typed, so our good old concatenation it&rsquo;s not that strongly typed (unless you go crazy and learn typescript). I would recommend to do 2 small project websites with javascript, a calculator and a tic tac toe. It sounds easy, but believe me, it will be a pain in the ass.</li>
<li>Go crazy and learn a Framework -  In this step I&rsquo;m learning REACT, mostly because it&rsquo;s the most popular, but Front End Frameworks like SVELTE and VUE might be more friendly and joyful. A FRAMEWORK it&rsquo;s way more used than Javascript nowadays when it comes to developing web apps and websites, so this is important in the case of wanting a job lol.</li>
<li>Do Small Projects and Get Hired - Once you go crazy with Frameworks of both Front and Backend you can go crazy and try to make different projects, in my case I&rsquo;m doing a Web App for Youtubers, named TubePlanner, it is still a work in progress, but soon it will be ready for testing and deployment. Once you have in your portfolio some unique projects, it will be easier to get hired, and I&rsquo;m not going to lie, you will be learning a to by doing projects once you grasp the basics of everything, it will allow you to truly learn the tools, and hopefully get a Job.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-do-i-bring-to-the-table-by-being-a-game-developer">What do I bring to the table, by being a Game Developer?</h2>
<p>By being a game developer what I&rsquo;ve noticed is that my entire focus has been on the experience of my user, I make games to create fun experiences for my users. So by being a game developer first, I&rsquo;ve noticed that I find a lot of joy if my web apps and websites turn to be very easy to use, and great experiences.</p>
<p>Everything can be turned into a game - Games are not always what they seem to be, for example, by creating a global leader board in your app, you could literally create some sense of competition, a.k.a. a game. If you create Apps like games, at the end you will have great experiences for your users, and that&rsquo;s the beauty of being a game developer first, that I focus a lot on the experience of my users by gamifying my projects for my user.</p>
