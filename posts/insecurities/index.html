            <h2 id="it-happens-even-to-the-best-of-all-of-us">It happens, even to the best of all of us&hellip;</h2>
<p>Life is interesting sometimes, it bless you with people, it bless you with time, it bless you with commodity, it bless you with many things to be grateful for. I&rsquo;m grateful I&rsquo;m not going to lie, life is beautiful, but no matter what, there days, just like this, where life makes you think, makes you analyze your relationships, your passions, your projects, your path.</p>
<p>In the case you have experience the same, let me tell you that you&rsquo;re not alone, Life is tricky, it&rsquo;s beautiful yet challenging, it makes you wonder, if there&rsquo;s something special about yourself, about what you do, and what you&rsquo;re going to do in the future.</p>
<h2 id="it-started-with-her">It started with her</h2>
<p>Ever since the beginning of time, boy meets girl, boy fall in love, but then he thinks, he wonders, he overanalyzes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, I don&rsquo;t know if I should or shouldn&rsquo;t write about this, but I met a wonderful girl, a girl that I feel close even if we just have been getting to know each other very recently. I feel happy that I got to know her, but the fact of the matter is that, she has been making me think, analyze my situation, what have I brought to the table, to this world.</p>
<p>When it comes to love and relationships, I tend to overanalyze, overthink, over worry. I think about myself, and everything I&rsquo;ve done, I think about the possibility of this happening. I try my best to not overthink, not imply that she feels the same, probably she doesn&rsquo;t, but no matter what, I feel more and more drawn towards her. But also, she makes me think.</p>
<p>I start to think if I&rsquo;m good enough for her, if I have anything to offer to her, wether I&rsquo;m worthy of love or not.</p>
<h2 id="i-think-about-my-purpose-and-what-ive-done">I think about my purpose, and what I&rsquo;ve done</h2>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m not alone in this, but I feel like a work in progress, I guess everyone feels the same, I think. But since the beginning of my self development journey, I&rsquo;ve felt the need of improvement, the need of wanting a better life, wanting more out of me, and out this life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feeling that comes naturally, the feeling of not being enough. At least to me, it&rsquo;s a very natural feeling, it comes very often. And I&rsquo;m not saying this with any intention of being like &gt; Oh pity me&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I should be treated differently, everyone is going thru this shit, I think it is normal, I think.</p>
<p>But the truth is, I feel like I haven&rsquo;t accomplish anything, I don&rsquo;t have a job, I have somewhat of a good physic, but a shitty mindset, a head full of self doubts, a head full of insecurities.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-my-insecurities">What are my insecurities</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a story of Boy Meets Girl, Boy Fall in love, but then he thinks, he wonders, he overanalyzes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My Insecurities, I assume, are just like everyone else.</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I enough?</li>
<li>Am I living a fulfilling life?</li>
<li>Am I worthy of love?</li>
<li>Are my projects working?</li>
<li>Should I quit?</li>
<li>Should I focus on something else?</li>
<li>Should I run away?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s responsible of making me overanalyze and wonder about this questions, but she made me think about the first question, and that question took me into a path full of new questions. Is this anxiety? I don&rsquo;t know, truth of the matter, life is interesting.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-about-quitting">Thinking about quitting</h3>
<p>Thanks to the question about being enough, I started to think about my passion projects, the path that I embarked, the path of the self entrepreneur, using youtube and development as a path forward to make money, my family has been very supportive, but at what extent should I follow this path?</p>
<p>When is enough?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m getting to that point of thinking not about quitting precisely, but pausing it, following a good job, embarking into a path of getting my first development job, as a Fullstack Developer. I don&rsquo;t think is a bad path, the insecurities come to tell me that IF I follow that path, I will not be able to follow my passion the way I would like to do it. But I&rsquo;m not the same 20 year old, I&rsquo;m 24 now, I need a better life for myself, and my future family. I think I can do a bit of both, focusing most of my time in a paying job, and then my free time, spent in my passion, using my job as a investment for my projects, allowing me to make bigger projects, with the help of a better starting point when it comes to financial state.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-about-disappearing">Thinking about disappearing</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not talking to the extent of something really really bad, I&rsquo;m thinking about disappearing in the sense of my personal relationships, my time to be invested into me getting a better job, better opportunities for the future, a better life for me, and my family, and my future wife and family. Paying the price of abandon any type of simple dopamine hit.</p>
<p>Avoiding social media, scaping the internet, and embracing the hard work.</p>
<p>Become a Monk, become a better focused version of myself. So maybe one day, I&rsquo;ll be back a better version for myself, for her&hellip; or anyone that might come my path.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-about-my-progress">Thinking about my progress</h3>
<p>Every time I see myself in the mirror, the same words come directly to my head: &ldquo;meh, good enough, I guess&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m having the beginning of a mental health condition of having body dysmorphic disorder, of feeling small, even if I&rsquo;ve been getting bigger and bigger. I don&rsquo;t think I have it to the extent of being worried about it, to be honest, I do know that my body is improving a shit ton, but there are times where I think about getting more and more out of the gym.</p>
<p>Today was a great gym session, I added more weight, better tempo, better technique, overall I feel really strong, I feel like I&rsquo;m increasing the quality of my workout routines, so today was a good gym day I would say, and this insecurity I&rsquo;ve been actively working on it, so I would say that maybe sooner than later, I&rsquo;ll see a bigger improvement at the gym and my physique.</p>
<p>I need to remind myself that I&rsquo;m not that little fatty boy I used to be, I&rsquo;m stronger version of myself, the one I thought about becoming one day. The best version of myself so far.</p>
<h2 id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, I don&rsquo;t think this post was made for anyone but for me, I needed to talk with myself by writing something out, I&rsquo;m a bit more relaxed with my decisions, and let&rsquo;s see what happens in the future, if you read this far, let me know, write me an email at <a href="mailto:emilioblacksmithlush@gmail.com">emilioblacksmithlush@gmail.com</a> I want to get to know you, and wish you the best, in this interesting path forward.</p>
